## Project Title: Game Remake

This project is a remake created for educational purposes. It's a tribute to a game that played a significant role in my childhood. Now I decided to take on the challenge of programming and recreating this game from my past.

### Purpose
The main goal of this project is purely educational, aiming to improve my programming skills and gain a deeper understanding of game development. It is important to note that this project is not intended for any commercial use and is merely a personal effort to learn and grow.

### Development Status
It is important to highlight that this project is in its initial phase and is intended exclusively for educational purposes. No commercial use is planned or permitted. All rights to the original game art and content belong to the original creators. Development is an ongoing process, as I dedicate my free time to its progress.

## Disclaimer
This is a non-commercial project created exclusively for study and personal development. Any similarity to the original game is purely coincidental, and this project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the original creators.

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the creators of the original game for providing the inspiration and joy that fueled this endeavor. Additionally, I thank the open source community for the wealth of resources and knowledge they have contributed to this project.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or contribute to development. Let's make this learning journey a pleasant and collaborative experience!
